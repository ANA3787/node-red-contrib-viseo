## Developers

All framework modules are installed with NPM. 
Custom private modules should be deployed in a `node-red-contrib` directory. 
(The project template already contains this directory)


Update `nodesDir` property of [Node-RED configuration](https://nodered.org/docs/configuration) to use absolue path to the `node-red-contrib` folder as a module repository.
